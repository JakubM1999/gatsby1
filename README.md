# My First Project With Gatsby

<p>For this project I created a "Blog" using gatsby and mdx and it was very interesting, as you can see it's not finished but it was nice to try out gatsby
  I had some problems when installing new dependencies as I got many errors resualting in many vulnerabilities and some of them were critical, I ultimately
  fixed this by updating all of my dependencies which lowered vulnerabilities but they was still there, I don't exactly know what the issue was but "npm audit
  fix and npm audit fix --force" didn't work in this case.
  
  Other than that I a good time creating this project but I would like to try out NextJS for my next project and compare these two frameworks and see how they differ.
